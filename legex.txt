rectionality of activity interactions. (A) Representative time-frequencygram
of GCA during the task in monkey R.Time alignment is the same as in Fig. 1D. Causal
information flow from the NAc to M1 of each stage (upper panels) and from M1 to
the NAc (lower panels) is shown. (B) GCA population data from the NAc to M1 (left
panel) and from M1 to the NAc (right panel) during the task, obtained across all recordings in two monkeys (T and R). The number means the total
number of experimental days across the two monkeys. Shading indicates the SEM. (C) GCA networks. The x and y axes are the source and sink of
information, respectively.
